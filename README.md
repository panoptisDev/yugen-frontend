**Yugen Finance** is a DeFi-Yield aggregator that generates money by aggregating income from various initiatives. 
The platform also comes with a basic app that can be used on both desktop and mobile platforms. 
This makes Yugen Finance the first DeFi return aggregator that makes money with other platforms. 

Liquidity Provider Coins are placed on the Fantom, Avalanche, and Harmony blockchain in multiple farms by Yugen Finance. 
Farm tokens from the Yield Farming project are used to buy $YGN tokens, which are then distributed as farm tokens and staking incentives.

This project contains the main features of the Yugen app and is currently configured with 3 chains - 
  - Polygon Mainnet
  - Polygon Testnet 
  - Fantom Testnet
